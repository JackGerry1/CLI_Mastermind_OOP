# CLI_Mastermind_OOP

This is an object-oriented programming (OOP) based command-line interface (CLI) implementation of the classic Mastermind game in C#.

## How to Play

1. **Code Length**: Enter the desired length for the secret code (e.g., 4).
2. **Guesses**: Specify the number of guesses you'd like to have.
3. **Guess Format**: Enter your guess for the secret code on one line, separating each number with a space (e.g., `1 2 3 4`).

## Gameplay

- Red pegs indicate the correct number and position.
- White pegs indicate the correct number but the wrong position.
- The game ends when you've used all your guesses or guessed the code correctly.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- .NET Framework or .NET Core (depending on the project requirements)
- Visual Studio

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/JackGerry1/ImprovedMastermind
    ```
2. Open Visual Studio.

3. In Visual Studiohttps://github.com/JackGerry1/ImprovedMastermind, go to **File > Open > Project/Solution** and navigate to the cloned repository.

4. Select the project file (usually ending with .csproj extension) and click **Open**.

5. Visual Studio will load the project and its dependencies.

6. Build the project by going to **Build > Build Solution** or pressing **Ctrl + Shift + B**. This will restore the NuGet packages, compile the code, and generate the necessary binaries.

## Running the Program

1. Once the project is built successfully, **Run** the program.

2. The program will start executing, and the output will be a GUI Main Menu Screen. 

3. Now you can play the game.

## Additional Notes

- This implementation provides basic error handling for invalid inputs.
- The game supports customizable code lengths and guess counts.
- Feel free to modify and extend the code as needed!
